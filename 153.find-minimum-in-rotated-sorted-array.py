# Testcase Example:  '[3,4,5,1,2]'
#
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
# to you beforehand.
# 
# (i.e., Â [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]Â might become Â [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
# 
# Find the minimum element.
# 
# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
# Output: 0
